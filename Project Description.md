After reading about the monkeypox virus on the WHO website awhile back, I decided to make a project out of it. This project is an analysis of recently confirmed monkeypox cases around the globe from January 1, 2022 to June 8, 2022.\

Data was collected and stored in Excel before it was cleaned and analysed in PostgreSQL.

Data visualization was done using Power BI. Interactive dashboard available here: https://bit.ly/project-monkeypox

Documented the project steps here: https://medium.com/@seyifunmitan/monkeypox-should-we-be-worried-ea07152eadbf
